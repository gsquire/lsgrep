A simple script to help search for files by a fixed string or a regular expression.
You invoked it by typing:

    ruby lsgrep.rb directory -f foo

OR
  
    ruby lsgrep.rb directory -r bar

The -f option allows for fixed strings and -r for a regular expression.  Don't parse
ls, just use this instead!
